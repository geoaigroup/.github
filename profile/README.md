## GEOAI group  

GEOspatial Artificial Intelligence [(GEOAI)](https://geogroup.ai/) is a research group at the Lebanese National Center for Remote Sensing - CNRS.  
Our research is focused on AI-assisted mapping spanning various applications, including urban analytics, transportation, waterbodies monitoring and crop-yield estimation.  
We develop tools to automate the process of urban features extraction and crowd-source data collection. Evidence gained from our models allows for a robust humanitarian response and provides policymakers/key-stakeholders with insights to design tailored regulations and safety countermeasures for urban social good.
GEOAI group provides a unique opportunity for geospatial training in a professional research environment in Lebanon.  
We have hosted more than 60 students at both undergraduate and graduate levels since 2016.
